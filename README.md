# Logistic-Regression-Analysis
A comprehensive guide to implementing logistic regression for binary classification problems, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualizations. This notebook demonstrates logistic regression concepts and practical applications, with code examples and detailed explanations.
Data Preparation: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data preprocessing techniques to optimize model input.
Model Implementation: Setting up logistic regression from scratch and using libraries like Scikit-Learn, including parameter tuning for better model performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Analysis of various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC to assess model effectiveness.
Visualization: Detailed visualizations to understand model predictions, decision boundaries, and the impact of features on the outcome.
